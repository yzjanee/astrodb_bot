# Parse Data Table

## Instructions
Parse the data table file `$ARGUMENTS` and extract column information.

### Step 0: Read context documents

Read `references/astrodb-instructions.md` (shared conventions) and
`references/astrodb-build-instructions.md` (build-specific conventions) — together they cover the
artifact folder, decision log, directions document, and completion-checklist conventions this skill
follows.

### Step 1: Make sure Python is installed and the necessary libraries are available

Work through these options in order — stop at the first one that succeeds:

**Option 1: astropy is already available**
```bash
python3 -c "import sys; assert sys.version_info >= (3, 11), f'Python 3.11+ required, got {sys.version}'; import astropy; print('ok')"
```
If this prints `ok`, proceed directly to Step 2. If it raises an `AssertionError`, Python is too old — fall through to Option 2 or 3, which will use a newer Python automatically.

**Option 2: use `uv` (fast, no project directory needed)**
```bash
uv run --python 3.11 --with astropy --with pandas python3 script.py
```
If `uv` is installed, this handles everything — no separate install step required. The `--python 3.11` flag ensures Python 3.11+ is used. Use this form to run all scripts in Steps 2–3.

**Option 3: `uv` is not installed — use `pip`**

First verify the Python version:
```bash
python3 -c "import sys; assert sys.version_info >= (3, 11), f'Need Python 3.11+, got {sys.version}'"
```
If that passes:
```bash
pip install astropy pandas
python3 script.py
```
If that fails, tell the user Python 3.11 or greater is required and ask them to install it or activate an appropriate environment.

**Option 4: nothing works**

If none of the above work, tell the user you're unable to install the required libraries and ask them to run in an environment that has either `uv` or `pip` available.

### Step 2: Read the file

Use `astropy.table.Table.read()` first, which handles most formats automatically. Fall back to `pandas` if needed:

```python
import json, os
from astropy.table import Table

reader = None
pandas_method = None

# Detect format from file extension — more reliable than inspecting table metadata.
ext = os.path.splitext("$ARGUMENTS")[1].lower()
fmt_map = {
    '.fits': 'fits', '.fit': 'fits',
    '.csv': 'csv', '.ecsv': 'ecsv',
    '.hdf5': 'hdf5', '.h5': 'hdf5',
    '.vot': 'votable', '.xml': 'votable',
    '.parquet': 'parquet',
    '.xlsx': 'excel', '.xls': 'excel',
}
fmt = fmt_map.get(ext)

try:
    t = Table.read("$ARGUMENTS")
    reader = "astropy"
    n_rows = len(t)
    for col in t.columns:
        print(col, t[col].dtype)  # descriptions/units extracted in Step 3
except Exception:
    # Before falling back to pandas, check whether this is a CDS/AAS machine-readable
    # table (common for .txt/.dat files distributed alongside journal articles).
    # Table.read() can't auto-identify this format and raises above, but pandas.read_csv()
    # won't error either — it'll silently parse the header text into one garbage column.
    # See references/format-specific-metadata.md for details.
    with open("$ARGUMENTS") as f:
        head = f.read(4000)
    if "Byte-by-byte Description of file" in head:
        t = Table.read("$ARGUMENTS", format="ascii.mrt")
        reader = "astropy"
        fmt = "mrt"
        n_rows = len(t)
        for col in t.columns:
            print(col, t[col].dtype)
    else:
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.read_csv("$ARGUMENTS")  # adjust reader as needed
        reader = "pandas"
        pandas_method = "read_csv"  # update if a different reader was used
        n_rows = len(df)
        for col in df.columns:
            print(col, df[col].dtype)

# Write sidecar so downstream skills (e.g. astrodb-build-03-schema-match, astrodb-build-04-schema-validate)
# can reuse the same reader without re-discovering the format.
# Output file paths are added to the sidecar in Step 5.
with open("astrodb-build-artifacts/astrodb-parse-result.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump({
        "file_path": "$ARGUMENTS",
        "reader": reader,
        "format": fmt,
        "pandas_method": pandas_method,
        "n_rows": n_rows,
    }, f)
```

See `references/file-formats.md` for the full list of supported formats.

### Step 3: Extract column information

For each column, extract:
- **Column name**
- **Description** (from metadata/comments; use "—" if not available)
- **Units** (use "—" if not specified)
- **Data type** (e.g. `float64`, `int32`, `str`)

**Important:** `t[col].description` is only reliably populated for ECSV and CDS/MRT files. For all other formats (FITS, plain CSV, HDF5, VOTable, etc.), ignore what Step 2 printed for descriptions and extract them using the format-specific methods in `references/format-specific-metadata.md`.

#### Checking for sentinel fill values

Legacy fixed-width astronomy formats (MRT tables especially, but also older FITS/CSV exports) sometimes mark missing data with a literal placeholder — `999`, `-999`, `-99.9` — instead of a true null. These aren't caught by the reader, so a quick scan matters: if a numeric column's max or min value is a suspiciously round number that recurs far more often than its neighbors, treat it as a fill value rather than a real measurement, and note it in the output (see Step 5) rather than silently reporting it as data.

#### Checking for cells with more than one value

Some tables pack several values into one cell — most often references, e.g.
`"Bonaca2020, Ibata2024"`. A database field holds one value (a `reference` points to one
`Publications` row), so these need a decision later in `astrodb-build-03-schema-match`.

Check the reference column(s) and other short ID/category columns (names like `ref`,
`reference`, `bibcode`, `citation`, `name`, `stream`, `band`). Skip free-text columns such as
comments and descriptions, where commas are normal.

```python
multi_value_columns = {}
for col in cols_to_check:                       # the columns picked above
    values = [str(v).strip() for v in t[col]]   # or df[col] for pandas
    for sep in (",", ";", "|"):
        hits = [v for v in values if sep in v]
        if hits:
            multi_value_columns[col] = {"separator": sep, "n_rows": len(hits), "examples": hits[:3]}
            break
print(multi_value_columns)
```

Don't split or change the values here — report them: in the output notes (Step 5), in the
Checkpoint summary, and in the sidecar as `multi_value_columns` (Step 5) so
`astrodb-build-03-schema-match` can ask the user how to handle them. If none are found, say so
in the notes.

#### Converting dtypes to human-readable strings

The dtype printed by Step 2 may be a raw numpy code. Convert before displaying:

| Raw dtype | Display as |
|-----------|------------|
| `>f4`, `float32` | `float32` |
| `>f8`, `float64` | `float64` |
| `>i2`, `int16` | `int16` |
| `>i4`, `int32` | `int32` |
| `<U9` (any length) | `str` |
| `\|S10` (any length) | `str` |
| `bool` | `bool` |

For string columns, you may optionally note the length (e.g. `str (16-char)`) if it is meaningful.

#### Inferring missing descriptions

When a column has no description in the file metadata, try to infer one from context:

- Columns ending in `+` or `_plus` → upper uncertainty on the base column (e.g. `dmod+` → "Upper uncertainty on dmod")
- Columns ending in `-` or `_minus` → lower uncertainty (e.g. `dmod-` → "Lower uncertainty on dmod")
- Columns with `err`, `e_`, or `sig` prefixes/suffixes → errors or standard deviations; use the base column's description to construct the inferred description

If you can't infer a description confidently, leave it as "—".

#### Inferring missing units

When a column has no units in the file metadata, consult `references/units-inference.md` for the lookup table and uncertainty-column inheritance logic.

### Step 4: Ask the user to fill in any remaining gaps

After exhausting file metadata and inference, if there are still columns with missing descriptions or units, ask the user to fill them in — but only if the number is manageable (fewer than 10). Present each missing column one at a time and wait for the user's response before moving to the next.

For example:
> Column `vrot_s` has no description. Do you know what this column represents?

> Column `e=1-b/a` has no units. What units should this column have, or is it dimensionless?

If there are 10 or more columns still missing descriptions or units, output the table as-is with "—" placeholders and note at the end how many are missing, so the user can address them separately.

### Step 5: Output the results

Write both output files directly inside `astrodb-build-artifacts/` — no subdirectory. Name them
after the input file's base name with a `-parsed-data-table` suffix. **Do not overwrite existing
files** — if the file already exists, append `-1`, `-2`, etc. to the base name until a free name
is found. For example, if the input is `data/catalog.fits`, write:
- `astrodb-build-artifacts/catalog-parsed-data-table.md`
- `astrodb-build-artifacts/catalog-parsed-data-table.html`

Each file should begin with a metadata block:

```
# Column Information: <filename>

**File:** `<filename>`
**Format:** <format>
**Reader:** <astropy | pandas>
**Rows:** <n_rows>
**Columns:** <n_cols>
```

Then the markdown table:

| Column | Description | Units | Type |
|--------|-------------|-------|------|

Followed by notes as a bulleted list (e.g. missing metadata, inferred values, source file anomalies).

Do not display this table in the chat — instead, write it to a markdown file using the `Write` tool, and provide a link to that file in the chat.

Also render this result as an HTML file using the `Write` tool, with the same metadata block, table, and notes.

Display links to both the markdown table and the HTML file in the chat, and suggest opening the HTML file with a browser for best visualization.

After writing the output files, update the sidecar to record their paths:

```python
import json

with open("astrodb-build-artifacts/astrodb-parse-result.json") as f:
    sidecar = json.load(f)

sidecar["output_md"] = "astrodb-build-artifacts/<basename>-parsed-data-table.md"
sidecar["output_html"] = "astrodb-build-artifacts/<basename>-parsed-data-table.html"
sidecar["multi_value_columns"] = multi_value_columns  # from Step 3; {} if none

with open("astrodb-build-artifacts/astrodb-parse-result.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(sidecar, f)
```

### Checkpoint: Confirm before proceeding

After writing the output files, present a brief summary in chat:
- Total columns parsed, and how many rows are in the file
- How many descriptions/units came from file metadata, were inferred, or are still `—`
- Any anomalies (fallback reader used, columns with unexpected types, etc.)
- Columns where some cells hold more than one value (e.g. `"Bonaca2020, Ibata2024"`): which
  column, how many rows, and an example — or that none were found

Then ask the user to open the HTML file and explicitly confirm the results:

> I've written the parsed column table to `<path>`. Please review it and let me know:
> 1. Does the column list look complete?
> 2. Are any descriptions, units, or types wrong or missing?
> 3. Are there columns that should be skipped in the schema-match step?
> 4. Are you ready to proceed to `astrodb-build-03-schema-match`?

**Wait for the user's explicit confirmation before this skill is complete.** If they request
corrections, apply them and update the output files before asking again. Do not proceed to
`astrodb-build-03-schema-match` or any downstream skill until the user confirms the table is ready.

If the user asks why you chose a particular file format or reader, explain your choice and
record it in `build-workflow.md` (see Final Step). Never assume a format decision was obvious — if there
was any ambiguity, the user may want to know or change it.

> **Note:** `schema.yaml` is not created in this step or in `astrodb-build-03-schema-match`.
> It is generated later by `astrodb-build-05-schema-generate`.

## Final Step: Update `build-workflow.md`

Follow the convention in `references/astrodb-build-instructions.md`. Append one new entry to
`astrodb-build-artifacts/build-workflow.md` (create it with the standard header if it
doesn't exist yet). Record: which file was parsed, which reader was used and why, any
column descriptions or units that were inferred, what the user confirmed during gap-filling,
and any columns still missing metadata.

## Completion Checklist

Before telling the user the table is parsed, verify every item in your section of the workflow checklist file and reproduce
the evidence-annotated list here, per the **completion-checklist convention** in
`references/astrodb-build-instructions.md`. Don't claim a value you didn't actually extract.

- [ ] Descriptions were extracted using the format-specific methods in `references/format-specific-metadata.md` — not taken from what Step 2 printed (which is only reliable for ECSV and CDS/MRT).
- [ ] For a `.txt`/`.dat` input, you checked for the `Byte-by-byte Description of file` MRT signature before treating it as plain CSV.
- [ ] Numeric columns were spot-checked for sentinel fill values (e.g. `999`, `-999`); any found are noted in the output rather than reported as real data.
- [ ] Reference and other short ID/category columns were checked for cells holding more than one value (`,` `;` `|`); any found (column, row count, examples) are in the output notes, the Checkpoint summary, and the sidecar's `multi_value_columns` — or the notes say none were found.
- [ ] Missing descriptions/units were inferred where possible; for any still missing, you asked the user (when fewer than 10) or noted at the end how many remain.
- [ ] dtypes are shown as human-readable strings (e.g. `float64`, `str`), not raw numpy codes like `>f8`.
- [ ] Both the `.md` and `.html` files were written directly inside `astrodb-build-artifacts/` — no subdirectory — as `<base>-parsed-data-table.md`/`.html`, each beginning with the metadata block. An existing file was not overwritten; a `-1`/`-2` suffix was appended instead.
- [ ] The file was successfully read (astropy first, pandas fallback) in a verified Python 3.11+ environment, and the sidecar `astrodb-build-artifacts/astrodb-parse-result.json` records the reader, format, and row count — then was updated with the output file paths.
- [ ] You showed links to both files in the chat (the table was not dumped inline), asked the user to review and confirm before proceeding, and waited for their explicit confirmation (applying and re-confirming any requested corrections) before treating this skill as done.
- [ ] A decision-log entry was appended to `astrodb-build-artifacts/build-workflow.md` (created with the standard header if absent), recording the non-obvious choices this skill made and why — per the decision-log convention in `references/astrodb-build-instructions.md`.
- [ ] Any problem with the skills themselves was logged in `gotchas.md`, following the problem-log convention in `references/astrodb-instructions.md` — or there was none worth logging.
